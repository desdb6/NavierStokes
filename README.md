# NavierStokes
A python package used to simulate two-dimensional hydrodynamic systems, by solving the Navier-Stokes equations using finite-difference solvers. This is a package I made last year for my final exam, with some tweaks to improve usability. You can also find my report explaining the methods and functions to use this package.

navierstokes.py: Contains the package to simulate hydrodynamic systems.

main.py: Brief demonstration of how the package is meant to be used.

plots.py: Generates the plots for the report.

Report.pdf: Report on the navierstokes package and instructions on how to use it

ReportFits.xlsx: Contains fits for iteration speed
