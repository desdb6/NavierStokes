# NavierStokes
A python package used to simulate two-dimensional hydrodynamic systems, by solving the Navier-Stokes equations using finite-difference solvers. This is a package I made last year for my final exam, with some tweaks to improve usability. You can also find my report explaining the methods and functions to use this package.
